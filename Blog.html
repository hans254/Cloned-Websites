                    <p>Running a home-based business comes with several benefits, among which include being your boss, choosing <br> where to work from, and setting your hours. However, this does not mean it does not come with some challenges. <br> You only experience success with a home business when you offer a quality product or service to a target market.</p>
                    <p>This might sound easy, but most often, business owners are ineffective and inconsistent in their marketing <br> because they lack in-depth knowledge of the area. Having an understanding of how</p>

                    <img src="images/Exit-Strategy1.jpg">
                    <p>Securing financial support from a venture capitalist is not an easy task. Most of the time, only those who are <br> considered the “best of the best” get the venture capital that they need. But does that mean it’s almost <br> impossible to get one? Actually, it’s not. However, if you are really keen on closing the deal with your potential <br> investor, you should work hard to present your business perfectly. <br> There are many articles that sum-up the things that entrepreneurs should say when given a chance</p>
