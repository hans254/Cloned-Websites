                <p>"My company has been very pleased in using Funded.com's investor network. We have found two <br> qualified investors to help fund our company. We have also used Funded.com to help us build a <br> professional business plan that has been a good asset."</p>
                <h6>Entrepreneur Milton L</h6>
                <p>"Funded has been a primary resource of well qualified businesses that we like to participate in seed <br> and staged funding."</p>
                <h6>Angel Investor – Sam H</h6>
                <p>"I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident <br> that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will <br> be back for my next production."</p>
                <h6>Kind Regard – Oscar S</h6>
                <p>"Funded.com is a great way to share your business plan and proposals with an array of VCs for <br> business people needing funding. The responses were quick - and it saved time and money by the <br> quick flick of a button. I highly recommend this service to anyone looking for funding."</p>
                <h6>Entrepreneur- Leslye J</h6>
                <p>"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I <br> found on here. I was surprised at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. <br> Website was a big help!"</p>
                <h6>Rick R, GA</h6>
                <p>"Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and <br> Investors. It is the site I've had most success with. I had about 6 Investors either respond back or <br> contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much! I <br> love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues. I love the fact that we are able to <br> contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't <br> allow). It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site. Thank you <br> again."</p>

                <p>Funded.com was extremely helpful in creating our business plan. The staff was kind, patient, <br> knowledgeable, and did their work in a very satisfactory manner.
